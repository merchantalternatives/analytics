This project is to create viewable analytics using clickstream data (`clickstream.csv`) from the branded link shortener serp.ly (whitelableing short.io) to view data only for the items relevant to merchant alternatives (aka the links in the `short_url` column of `shortlinks.csv`).

For each link in the `short_url` column of `shortlinks.csv` we be able to visualize data for clicks from various time periods (last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, all time) and for various mediums (like where it came from) as well as.

We should also be able to see which links are "affilaite monetized" (based on the value in `original_url`).
